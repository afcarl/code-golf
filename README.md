code-golf
=========

StackExchange Code Golf and little snippets of code. All for fun.

I'll try to keep a description of what is what organized here, but most of this is code written on impulse very late at night.

+ brownnumbers
    + brownNoser.py implements the Babylonian method of finding a perfect square to isolate brown numbers
    + bab-timer.py times the Babylonian method of finding a perfect square for runtime analysis // complexity approximation
+ big-number.py tries to print a very large number with very few characters.
+ flipped-number.m flips a number upside down.
+ randomness-test.py determines the degree of randomness of python's pseudorandom number generator by comparing a random string to a compressed random string, to prove to myself that randomness doesn't increase with iteration.
+ matrix-compare.m compares two matrices.
+ rotate.m rotates a matrix. Easy.
