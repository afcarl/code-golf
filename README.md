code-golf
=========

StackExchange Code Golf and little snippets of code. All for fun.

Update June 30, 2016: I think I will use this more for one-off scripts that I do not think will be generally useful... but you never know :)

I'll try to keep a description of what is what organized here, but most of this is code written on impulse very late at night.

+ brownnumbers
    + brownNoser.py implements the Babylonian method of finding a perfect square to isolate brown numbers
    + bab-timer.py times the Babylonian method of finding a perfect square for runtime analysis // complexity approximation
+ golf
	+ big-number.py tries to print a very large number with very few characters.
	+ flipped-number.m flips a number upside down.
	+ matrix-compare.m compares two matrices.
	+ rotate.m rotates a matrix. Easy.
+ test-recursion.py tests time taken for recursive and non-recursive factorial calculations.
+ tf-idf.py is a rudimentary implementation of tf-idf.
+ tictactoe.py is an attempted CLI for tic tac toe.
+ recursive.py is a meta-recursive Python script. Rather than recursively calling a function, it infinitely recursively starts a new Python process runnint itself. Spooooky.
+ markov.py does something with letters and a markov chain. I think it generates fake words.
+ randomness-test.py determines the degree of randomness of python's pseudorandom number generator by comparing a random string to a compressed random string, to prove to myself that randomness doesn't increase with iteration.
+ sports-scraper.py scrapes sportslogos.net for sports teams logos, part of work I did with Simar Mangat @ Pavlov.
